DOMAIN: MACHINE LEARNING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION:
Image Classification is a fundamental task in computer vision and deep learning. It involves training a model to assign labels to images based on their content. One of the most effective techniques for image classification is using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) â€” a type of deep learning model that automatically extracts hierarchical features from images.

In this internship task, we implement and train a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow (or PyTorch) to classify images from a given dataset. The goal is to build a robust image classifier that can generalise well on unseen data, evaluate its performance, and visualise results.

CNNs are well-suited for image data as they preserve spatial hierarchies in the data. Unlike traditional fully connected networks, CNNs use convolutional layers that slide filters over the input to detect patterns such as edges, textures, and complex features at deeper layers.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset:
We use a standard benchmark dataset such as CIFAR-10, MNIST, or Fashion-MNIST, which contains thousands of labelled images across multiple categories. For example, CIFAR-10 has 60,000 colour images across 10 classes like aeroplane, dog, car, cat, etc.

âœ… Implementation Steps:
Import Required Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch), NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn.
Load and Explore Dataset: Load the dataset, visualise sample images, and understand the label distribution.
Data Preprocessing: Normalise pixel values, perform label encoding, and split the dataset into training and test sets.
Model Building:
Create a CNN architecture using layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense.
Add dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
Model Compilation & Training:
Use categorical cross-entropy loss and an optimiser like Adam.
Fit the model on training data while validating on test data.
Model Evaluation:
Plot training/validation accuracy and loss curves.
Generate classification reports and a confusion matrix.
Prediction & Visualisation:
Predict test samples and visualise results.
Display correctly and incorrectly classified examples.
ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Understand and apply CNN architecture for image classification.
Gain experience using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Learn techniques to prevent overfitting (dropout, data augmentation).
Evaluate model performance and interpret its results.
Visualise how the model learns and what it gets right or wrong.
ðŸ“Œ Conclusion:
This project offers hands-on experience with deep learning in image classification tasks. By implementing a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch, we deepen our understanding of how image data can be processed and classified using modern techniques.

CNNs remain at the core of many computer vision applications â€” from facial recognition and self-driving cars to medical imaging and surveillance. The ability to build and evaluate such a model is a crucial skill for aspiring machine learning engineers and data scientists.

By the end of this notebook, we will deliver a fully functional model capable of accurate image classification, along with insights into its strengths, limitations, and areas for improvement. This project showcases our deep learning proficiency and readiness for real-world AI challenges.
